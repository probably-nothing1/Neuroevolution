# GeneticAlgorithms
Implementation of:
1. Simple Genetic Algorithm

# Reference:
1. Deep Neuroevolution: Genetic Algorithms Are a Competitive Alternative for Training Deep Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning [https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06567]
2. Abandoning Objectives: Evolution through the
Search for Novelty Alone [https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~meeden/DevelopmentalRobotics/lehman_ecj11.pdf]


# Tricks:
1. Deep GA [1]. (Kind of like common seed but taken to the extreme. Each model is a series of seeds that produced it)
2. Novelty Search [2][1]
